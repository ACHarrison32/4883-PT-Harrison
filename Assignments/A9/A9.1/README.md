## P11085 - Back to the 8 Queens

### Andrew Harrison

### Description:
You are given a chess board (of 8 ×8 dimension) and there are 8 queens placed randomly on the board.
Each of the 8 queens is in different columns and that means no two queens are attacking each other
vertically. But some queens are attacking each other horizontally and/or diagonally. You have to move
the queens so that no two queens are attacking each other from any direction. You are allowed to move
the queens vertically and thus you can only change the row positions of each queen and not the column.
A move consists of moving a queen from (R1, C) to (R2, C) where 1 ≤R1, R2 ≤8 and R1 ̸= R2.
You have to find the minimum number of moves required to complete the task.
