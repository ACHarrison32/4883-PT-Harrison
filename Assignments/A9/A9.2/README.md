## P12988 - Sodoku

### Andrew Harrison

### Description:
Yi Sima was one of the best counselors of Cao Cao. He likes to play a funny game himself. It looks like
the modern Sudoku, but smaller.
Actually, Yi Sima was playing it different. First of all, he tried to generate a 4 ×4 board with every
row contains 1 to 4, every column contains 1 to 4. Also he made sure that if we cut the board into four
2 ×2 pieces, every piece contains 1 to 4.
Then, he removed several numbers from the board and gave it to another guy to recover it. As
other counselors are not as smart as Yi Sima, Yi Sima always made sure that the board only has one
way to recover.
Actually, you are seeing this because you’ve passed through to the Three-Kingdom Age. You can
recover the board to make Yi Sima happy and be promoted. Go and do it!!!
