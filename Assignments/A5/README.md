## P514 - Rails
### Andrew Harrison

### Description:
The local tradition is that every train arriving from the direction A continues in the direction B with
coaches reorganized in some way. Assume that the train arriving from the direction A has Nâ‰¤1000
coaches numbered in increasing order 1,2,...,N. The chief for train reorganizations must know whether
it is possible to marshal coaches continuing in the direction B so that their order will be a1.a2,...,aN.
Help him and write a program that decides whether it is possible to get the required order of coaches.
