## P10443 - Rock, Scissors, Paper
### Andrew Harrison

### Description:
Bart’s sister Lisa has created a new civilization on a two- dimensional grid. At the outset each grid location may
be occupied by one of three life forms: Rocks, Scissors, or P apers. Each day, differing life forms occupying 
horizontally or vertically adjacent grid locations wage war. In each war, Rocks always defeat Scissors, Scissors 
always defeat Papers, and Papers always defeat Rocks. At the end of the day, the victor expands its territory to 
include the loser’s grid position. The loser vacates the position. Your job is to determine the territory occupied 
by each lifeform after n days.
