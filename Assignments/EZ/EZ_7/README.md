## P11764 - Jumping Mario
### Andrew Harrison
### Description:

Mario is in the final castle. He now needs to jump over few walls and then enter the Koopaâ€™s Chamber 
where he has to defeat the monster in order to save the princess. You will be given the heights of N 
walls from left to right. Mario is currently standing on the first wall. He has to jump to the 
adjacent walls one after another until he reaches the last one. A high jump is one where Mario has
to jump to a taller wall, and similarly, a low jump is one where Mario has to jump to a shorter wall. 
Can you find out the total number of high jumps and low jumps Mario has to make?
