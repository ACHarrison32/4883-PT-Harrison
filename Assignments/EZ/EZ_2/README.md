## P11044 - Searching For Nessy
### Andrew Harrison
### Description:

In July 2003, the BBC reported an extensive investigation of Loch Ness by a BBC team, using 600 
separate sonar beams, found no trace of any “sea monster” (i.e., any large animal, known or
unknown) in the loch. The BBC team concluded that Nessie does not exist. Now we want to repeat 
the experiment. Given a grid of n rows and m columns representing the loch, 6 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000,
find the minimum number s of sonar beams you must put in the square such that we can control every 
position in the grid, with the following conditions:
• one sonar occupies one position in the grid; the sonar beam controls its own cell and the contiguous 
cells.
• the border cells do not need to be controlled, because Nessy cannot hide there (she is too big).
