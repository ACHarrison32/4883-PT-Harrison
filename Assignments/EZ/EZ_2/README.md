## P11875 - Brick Game
### Andrew Harrison
### Description:

Brick game is a team game. Each team consists of odd number of players. Number of players must be greater 
than 1 but cannot be greater than 10. Age of each player must be within 11 and 20. No two players can have
the same age. There is a captain for each team. The communication gap between two players depends on their 
age difference, i.e. the communication gap is larger if the age difference is larger. Hence they select the
captain of a team in such a way so that the number of players in the team who are younger than that captain 
is equal to the number of players who are older than that captain. Ages of all members of the team are 
provided. You have to determine the age of the captain.
