## P12165 - Triangle Hazards
### Andrew Harrison

### Problem Description:
In the picture below you can see a triangle ABC. Point D, E and F divides the sides BC, CA and AB
into m1:m2, m3:m4 and m5:m6 ratios respectively. A, D; B, E and C, F are connected. AD and BE
intersects at P, BE and CF intersects at Q and CF and AD intersects at R.

So now a new triangle PQR is formed. Given triangle ABC it is very easy to find triangle PQR,
but given triangle PQR it is not straight forward to find ABC. Your task is now to do that.
