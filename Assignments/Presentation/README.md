## P12165 - Triangle Hazards
### Andrew Harrison

### Problem:
In the picture below you can see a triangle ABC. Point D, E and F divides the sides BC, CA and AB
into m1:m2, m3:m4 and m5:m6 ratios respectively. A, D; B, E and C, F are connected. AD and BE
intersects at P, BE and CF intersects at Q and CF and AD intersects at R.

So now a new triangle PQR is formed. Given triangle ABC it is very easy to find triangle PQR,
but given triangle PQR it is not straight forward to find ABC. Your task is now to do that.

### Menelaus's Theorem
Let P, Q, R be points on lines BC, CA, AB in a triangle ABC, distinct from its verticies. 
Then P, Q, R are collinear if and only if  <img src="https://github.com/ACHarrison32/4883-PT-Harrison/blob/main/Assignments/Presentation/Menelaus.PNG" width="200">

where the lengths are directed.

When looking at the problem given we are able to break the triangle up into 3 seperate triangles.
